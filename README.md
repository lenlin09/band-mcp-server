# Band MCP Server

A fully functional Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that integrates with the [Band API](https://developers.band.us/develop/guide/api). This server enables seamless interaction with Band social platform data through AI assistants and other MCP-compatible tools.

## ✅ Project Status: Production Ready

**Version:** 1.0.3  
**Docker Image:** `kanghouchao/band-mcp-server:latest`

This MCP server is fully implemented and provides complete access to Band API functionality including user profiles, band management, posts, comments, albums, and photos with full read/write capabilities.

## Key Features

✅ **Access Token Authentication**: Secure authentication using Band API access tokens  
✅ **Complete Band API Coverage**: Full implementation of all major Band API endpoints  
✅ **Read/Write Operations**: Comprehensive CRUD operations for posts, comments, and band data  
✅ **MCP Integration**: Native MCP tools and resources for seamless AI integration  
✅ **Docker Deployment**: Production-ready containerized deployment  
✅ **TypeScript Implementation**: Type-safe implementation with full error handling  
✅ **Automated CI/CD**: Continuous integration and automated Docker builds

## Features

- **Access Token Authentication**: Securely authenticate using Band API access tokens.
- **MCP Resources**: Fetch and expose Band posts as MCP resources.
- **MCP Tools**: Enable read/write operations on Band data via MCP tools.
- **TypeScript Implementation**: Leverage TypeScript for type safety and maintainability.
- **Dockerized Deployment**: Simplify deployment with a Docker container.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Band API access token (obtainable from [Band Developer Portal](https://developers.band.us/develop/myapps/list))
- VS Code with MCP support or any MCP-compatible client
- Docker (for containerized deployment)

### VS Code Integration

Add the following configuration to your VS Code `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "inputs": [
      {
        "type": "promptString",
        "id": "band_access_token",
        "description": "BAND Access Token",
        "password": true
      }
    ],
    "servers": {
      "band-mcp-server": {
        "command": "docker",
        "args": ["run", "--rm", "-i", "-e", "BAND_ACCESS_TOKEN", "kanghouchao/band-mcp-server:latest"],
        "env": {
          "BAND_ACCESS_TOKEN": "${input:band_access_token}"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- **`permissions`** - Check user permissions for a specific Band (posting, commenting, deletion rights)

### Posts & Content
- **`get_posts`** - Get posts from a specific Band with pagination support
- **`get_post`** - Get detailed information about a specific post
- **`write_post`** - Create a new post in a Band group
- **`remove_post`** - Delete a post from a Band (requires appropriate permissions)

### Comments & Interactions
- **`get_comments`** - Get comments for a specific post with sorting options
- **`write_comment`** - Add a comment to a post
- **`remove_comment`** - Delete a comment from a post (requires appropriate permissions)

### Media & Albums
- **`get_albums`** - Get photo albums in a Band group
- **`get_photos`** - Get photos from a specific album

### Usage Examples

```typescript
// Get all bands the user belongs to
await mcp.callTool("get_bands", {});

// Get recent posts from a specific band
await mcp.callTool("get_posts", {
  band_key: "AADoj33YIR6g5reUiHGZx0wj",
  limit: 20
});

// Create a new post
await mcp.callTool("write_post", {
  band_key: "AADoj33YIR6g5reUiHGZx0wj",
  content: "Hello from MCP! 🚀",
  do_push: false
});

// Add a comment to a post
await mcp.callTool("write_comment", {
  band_key: "AADoj33YIR6g5reUiHGZx0wj",
  post_key: "AAB8tbywKWMoGQFLqd_EhiBD",
  body: "Great post! 👍"
});
```

## Error Handling & API Limits

The server implements comprehensive error handling and respects Band API rate limits:

- **Authentication errors**: Clear error messages for invalid or expired tokens
- **Permission errors**: Detailed feedback when operations require higher permissions
- **Rate limiting**: Automatic handling of API rate limits with appropriate delays
- **Validation**: Input validation for all parameters using Zod schemas
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring

- `npm run test` - Run test suite
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `make help` - Show all available Makefile commands

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Authentication failed"
- Verify your Band API access token is valid and not expired
- Ensure the token has the necessary permissions for the operations you're trying to perform
- Check that the token is correctly set in the environment variable `BAND_ACCESS_TOKEN`

#### "Permission denied" errors
- Some operations require specific roles within a Band (leader, co-leader, etc.)
- Use the `permissions` tool to check your access rights for a specific Band
- Contact the Band administrator to request appropriate permissions

#### Docker container issues
- Ensure Docker is running and you have sufficient permissions
- Check that the environment variable is properly passed to the container
- Verify the Docker image is up to date: `docker pull kanghouchao/band-mcp-server:latest`

#### MCP client connection issues
- Verify your MCP client supports the required protocol version
- Check that the server command and arguments are correctly configured
- Review VS Code or client logs for detailed error messages

### Debug Mode

To enable detailed logging, set the environment variable:
```bash
export DEBUG=band-mcp-server:*
```

## Roadmap

### Planned Improvements
- [ ] Response data optimization for better AI processing performance
- [ ] Combined API tool for complex operations
- [ ] Enhanced error recovery and retry mechanisms
- [ ] Additional Band API endpoint coverage
- [ ] Performance monitoring and metrics
- [ ] Multi-language support for error messages

### Performance Optimization
Current focus is on optimizing API response data to improve AI processing speed by:
- Filtering unnecessary data fields
- Implementing selective field queries
- Reducing payload sizes for better performance

## Security Considerations

- **Token Security**: Never commit access tokens to version control
- **Environment Variables**: Always use environment variables for sensitive data
- **Permissions**: Follow principle of least privilege when requesting API permissions
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect Band API rate limits to avoid service disruption
- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated using Zod schemas
